			"text":"After testing the fi rst design of this multifunctional product we realised that the product was unstable and the comfortability wasn’t great. We decided to develop a new design changing the shape of CDC. The only thing needed to make the product more stable was to turn it upside down. That was not the only thing that we changed. It’s really difi cult to produce an entire piece of wood bended to be curved, so we decided to use straight lines. After fi xing the problem of stability the design is larger and lighter than before. However, comfortabulity was still an issue and another problem was found regarding the joints of the chair.",

CDC will be useful for students, professionals, designers, co-workers... Due to the comfortability and joint problems we changed the design once more and now we have our final design. We stuck with the straight lines and the shape is like the previous design. However now the design is lighter and more comfortable. We followed a trapezoidal design using the same shape in the bottom and top parts of the product. The problems with the joints were solved by using a wooden frame and fi lling the space in between with plywood, making a high-quality product, cheap, comfortable and appealing. With this design we also changed the use of the coffee table. In the previous versions of this product the coffee table was a large piece which you could use for storage. Our new design consists of two tables which can be used as a stool.',
